        <h2>ADOPT</h2>
        <p class="adoptpar">Adopting from Animal Rescue, Inc. can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life.</p>

        <p class="adoptpar">When you adopt a new best friend from PAWS, you are saving a life that might not have had a chance without your kindness. The first step is to fill out our adoption application, which is available here or at any of our adoption locations.</p>

        <p class="adoptpar">There is a fee of $220 to adope a dog and $85 to adopt a cat. Applications generally take 24-48 hours for approval. There is a possibility for same day adoption, but we cannot guarantee it. Please present your application at a PAWS Adoption Center in person at least one hour prior to closing time. You may also mail it to 100 N. 2nd Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106 or email it to <a class="mail" href="mailto:adoptions@phillypaws.org">adoptions@phillypaws.org</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="foster">Foster Homes</h3>

        <p class="adoptpar">Foster homes are also at the heart of PAWS’ ability to save lives. There is always an animal who needs you; fostering is one of the most rewarding experiences imaginable.</p>

        <p class="adoptpar">Foster parents are needed for dogs, cats, and kittens. PAWS provides vet care, spay/neuter surgery, donated food and supplies when possible, and exposure to potential adopters through adoption events, media appearances, and online marketing.</p>

        <p class="adoptpar">Thousands of animals who are too young or too sick to be adopted arrive at the city’s animal control shelter each year. Temporary foster care gives them a chance at life, something the shelter cannot offer. The need for foster care is great throughout the year, but it is particularly urgent during “kitten season,” April through October, when hundreds of cats and kittens can arrive at the shelter on any given day.</p>

            <strong>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT: LAUREN-ALICE LAMANNA</strong>
            <p>Lauren-Alice started volunteering in 2012 and became a very active volunteer immediately (even recruiting her boyfriend as a volunteer!). “When I started dating my other half Ryan (a fellow PAWS volunteer), I soon fell in love with his cat Baby and realized just how much having a pet adds to your life, and what a valuable part of the family they are“, says Lauren-Alice. She volunteers with the cats at the Adoption center, works adoption events and even became an orientation leader for our Adoption Center. What keeps her coming back?  “Aside from the wonderful PAWS cats and dogs, what keeps me coming back is the amazing PAWS staff. Seeing how committed they are to their jobs and how deeply they care for the animals is inspiring to me. And of course, my fellow volunteers are a pretty fantastic bunch too!”.  The PAWS staff is lucky to have Lauren-Alice as a member of the PAWS family! Volunteers, like Lauren-Alice, make it possible for us to do all that we can each day!</p>

        <h2>CONTACT</h2>
        <p>Thank you for visiting! Please complete the form below to be contacted by the appropriate staff person.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> PAWS rescues as many animals from the city’s animal control shelter as we have room for on a daily basis and remains full at all times. (Animals at the city’s high-volume shelter are all in danger of being killed.) Therefore, we typically do not take in animals from the public. However, if you have adopted an animal from PAWS that you cannot or will not keep, you must return it to us.
        </p>
        <p><strong>If you cannot or will not keep your pet:</strong> We strongly urge you to re-home the animal yourself rather than surrender it to a shelter. Ask your friends and family, post fliers in your neighborhood, post listings on free web sites such as Craigslist, Facebook, etc., or contact breed-specific rescues (if applicable) to see if they can assist you. Charging a small re-homing fee and checking vet references are good ways to help screen applicants and find a good home for your pet.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>If you have absolutely no other options, you must bring your pet to your county’s animal control shelter. <strong>Please do this only as a last resort, as animals turned in to these facilities may be euthanized (put to sleep, killed).</strong> For Philadelphia residents, animal control is performed by:
